name:                fooua
version:             0.1.0.0a
synopsis:            This is a thing made just fooua!
description:         A description should be long and span multiple lines.  If
                     it doesn't, it couldn't possibly be very descriptive, eh?
                         But then again, the fact that each line is prefixed with
                     whitespace is fun.
